;;; Commentary:

;; My-Whisper provides simple speech-to-text transcription using
;; Whisper.cpp.  It records audio via sox and transcribes it using
;; Whisper models, inserting the transcribed text at your cursor.

;; Features:
;; - Two transcription modes: fast (base.en) and accurate (medium.en)
;; - Custom vocabulary support for specialized terminology
;; - Automatic vocabulary length validation
;; - Async processing with process sentinels
;; - Clean temporary file management

;; Basic usage:
;;   M-x my-whisper-transcribe-fast  ; Fast mode (base.en model)
;;   M-x my-whisper-transcribe       ; Accurate mode (medium.en)

;; Default keybindings:
;;   C-c v - Fast transcription
;;   C-c n - Accurate transcription

;; See the README for installation and configuration details.
