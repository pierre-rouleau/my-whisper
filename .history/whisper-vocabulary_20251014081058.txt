Well, everyone else said the same things as Chaerephon, and I said, “By Heracles, you are
describing a man without an equal—if he should happen to have one small thing in

“What’s that?” asked Critias. “You probably know him,” he said, “but he was not yet grown up when you went away. He is Charmides, the son of my mother’s brother Glaucon, and my cousin.”

24 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. 25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor[a] and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.

27 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. 28 For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
